# Graph Algorithms

This project involves the creation of a graph visualization tool with a user-friendly GUI using Java. The application enables users to construct graphs from scratch through an intuitive interface, allowing them to add nodes, edges, and customize graph properties. The core feature includes implementing Kruskal's algorithm, a widely used algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees in a graph.
